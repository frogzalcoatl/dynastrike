# Summary (AKA “Quick-and-Dirty Cheat Sheet for People Who Don’t Read”)
* You may clone or download the Software (including older commits) and experiment on your own machine, debug, break things, scream into the void.

* You may not redistribute, repurpose, or integrate any fragment (“snippet”) of this code into anything else.

* This License covers past commits and this commit.

* You may not use it commercially or in any project beyond your own private sandbox.

* If a new license is issued, that new license eclipses this one. Until then, it’s proprietary.

* Crack it, fix it, learn from it, just don’t try to smuggle any part of it into your own work. Licensor’s watching.

# LICENSE

IMPORTANT, READ CAREFULLY:
This License (the “License”) governs your use of the accompanying codebase (the “Software”). By accessing, downloading, installing, or otherwise using the Software (for example, by “messing around with it locally”), you agree to be bound by the terms of this License. If you do not agree to these terms, do not access or use the Software in any manner.

1. Definitions

1.1 “Software” means all source code, binaries, documentation, scripts, configuration files, and any other material provided by the author (“Licensor”) in connection with this codebase as of the date you obtained it, including all commits, past, present, and future, in the same repository.

1.2 “License Term” means the period during which this License is in effect, starting on the date you first download or otherwise obtain the Software and ending only when the Licensor publishes an explicit, alternate license that supersedes this License.

1.3 “You” (or “Licensee”) means the individual or legal entity exercising rights under this License.

1.4 “Use” means to run, load, execute, or interact with the Software on a computer or other device, but explicitly does not include copying or adopting any portion of the Software (including snippets) into another project or distribution.

1.5 “Local Copy” means a private installation or clone of the Software on your personal device or within your private, non-networked development environment.

1.6 “Derivative Work” means any software, documentation, or other work that is based upon (or derived from) the Software, whether in whole or in part, by incorporation of any portion of the Software, including but not limited to code snippets, algorithms, data structures, or any other element.

1.7 “Repository History” refers to all commits, branches, tags, and revisions that have ever existed or will exist in the repository where the Software resides.

2. Ownership

2.1 All copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, and other intellectual property rights in and to the Software remain the exclusive property of the Licensor. This License grants you no ownership rights whatsoever.

2.2 The Licensor reserves all rights not expressly granted under this License.

3. Grant of Limited License

3.1 Local, Non-Commercial Use Only.
(a) Subject to your strict compliance with the terms below, the Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to download and maintain a Local Copy of the Software solely for your personal experimentation, testing, and “tinkering around” on your own device(s), provided that you never deploy the Software in any production environment or on any public network.
(b) For clarity: You may build, run, and debug the Software on your personal machine(s), but you may never share, distribute, or use it for any commercial, academic, or public purpose beyond private experimentation.

3.2 No Sub-Licensing.
(a) You may not sublicense, rent, lease, or lend the Software (or any portions thereof) to any third party.
(b) You may not grant any rights in the Software to anyone else, whether directly or indirectly.

4. Prohibited Uses

4.1 No Incorporation or Snippet Reuse.
(a) You shall not reproduce, repurpose, or incorporate any part of the Software, be it a single line of code (“snippet”) or a complete module, into any other software, project, or distribution. All code, comments, algorithms, and even low-level ideas found in the Software are off-limits for reuse.

4.2 No Distribution.
(a) You may not distribute, publish, sublicense, rent, lease, or otherwise make the Software (or any portion thereof) available to any third party, in source or binary form.
(b) Any attempt to redistribute, even if “just a little snippet” or obfuscated or as a gist, is strictly forbidden.

4.3 No Commercial Exploitation.
(a) You may not sell, rent, lease, or otherwise monetize the Software, in whole or in part.
(b) You may not use the Software to develop any product or service that is offered for sale or to generate revenue, whether directly or indirectly.

4.4 No Network or Public Deployment.
(a) Under no circumstances may you deploy or host the Software (or any service derived from it) on any network or public server, including but not limited to web servers, cloud instances, staging servers, or any shared/private networked environment.
(b) You must keep your use strictly local. If your “local” environment ever becomes network-reachable (intentionally or accidentally), you are in violation of this License.

5. Modification Disclaimer

5.1 Internal Changes Only.
(a) You may modify your Local Copy of the Software for the sole purpose of personal experimentation, debugging, or learning.
(b) However, any modified version remains subject to all restrictions in Section 4. You may not distribute or share your modifications in any form.

5.2 Retention of Notices.
(a) Any copy of the Software you maintain, even if modified, must retain all original copyright, trademark, and license notices.

6. Applicability to Repository History

6.1 Retroactive Coverage.
(a) This License applies to all versions of the Software present in the Repository History, including any commits made prior to the date you obtained the Software.
(b) By obtaining any copy of this repository, regardless of branch or commit identifier, you agree that every past, present, and future commit in that repository is governed by this License until a New License (see Section 9) is published.
(c) Nothing in the Repository History grants you any rights beyond what is expressly stated herein.

7. Termination

7.1 Automatic Termination.
(a) This License will terminate automatically (without notice) if you fail to comply with any provision of this License. Upon termination, you must immediately destroy all Local Copies of the Software (including any clones of older commits) and cease all use.

7.2 Licensor’s Right to Terminate.
(a) The Licensor may terminate this License at any time, with or without cause, by providing notice to you. Upon receipt of such notice, you must immediately cease all use of the Software and delete/destroy any Local Copies.

7.3 Survival.
(a) Sections 1, 2.1, 2.2, 4 (Prohibited Uses), 6 (Applicability to Repository History), 7.1–7.2, 8 (Warranty Disclaimer), and 9 (Limitation of Liability) survive termination of this License.

8. Warranty Disclaimer

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR ANY WARRANTY ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE PRACTICE. LICENSED PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE SOFTWARE MAY CONTAIN BUGS, COUNT ON ITS FRAGILITY AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND PLEASE DON’T COME CRYING WHEN THE BUILD FAILS. (Seriously, don’t.)

9. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF PROFITS; LOSS OF DATA; LOSS OF BUSINESS; OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS) ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH:

THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE,

DELAY OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE,

USE OF OR RELIANCE ON ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED OR PROVIDED THROUGH THE SOFTWARE,

OR FOR ANY OTHER CLAIM ARISING FROM THE SOFTWARE OR THIS LICENSE,
WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

(Yes, that includes you debugging at 3 a.m. and deciding it’s Licensor’s fault the unit tests broke.)

10. Future License Changes

10.1 Provisional Nature.
(a) This License remains in effect only until such time as the Licensor chooses to relicense the Software under different terms (the “New License”).
(b) When, and only when, the Licensor publishes a New License (for example, in a LICENSE file committed to the repository or in a public announcement), the New License’s terms will supersede this License in full.

10.2 No Retroactivity Beyond This License.
(a) Any New License will apply prospectively from the date of publication. Use of the Software (including Repository History) prior to that date remains governed by this License.

10.3 Notice of Change.
(a) The Licensor may provide notice of a New License via the same distribution channel through which this Software was made available. Once that notice is public, this License automatically expires and the New License applies instead.

11. Miscellaneous

11.1 Governing Law.

(a) This License will be governed by, construed, and enforced in accordance with the laws of the United States of America, without regard to conflicts of law provisions.

11.2 Severability.
(a) If any provision of this License is held invalid or unenforceable for any reason (e.g., a judge finds you actually should be allowed to use that one line of code), that provision will be deemed to be reformed to the extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable, and the remaining provisions of this License will remain in full force and effect.

11.3 Entire Agreement.
(a) This License constitutes the entire agreement between Licensor and Licensee regarding the Software and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications, whether oral or written.

11.4 No Waiver.

11.5 Assignment.
(a) You may not assign or transfer your rights or obligations under this License without the prior written consent of Licensor, and any attempt to do so is void.
